# CropReplant
A Valheim mod forked from [JohnDowson/CropReplant](https://github.com/JohnDowson/CropReplant)

On v0.1.6.x I'll do :

- Adding new crop

On v2.1.x I'll do :

- Minor fix 
- Adding new crop
- Little improvement

# How to use 2.1.x

1) Equip a Cultivator
2) Point your crosshair to your fully grown crop
3) Right click, Left click a plant you want to plant/replant in the cultivator build menu
4) Right click again, then Middle mouse click the plant you want to replant while in the cultivator build menu.

Alternatively, use "UseCustomReplantKey = true" in the config to use the previous H key to replant. 

1) Select the crop to replant in cultivator build menu
2) Hover the selected plant to any fully grown crop
3) Press H
